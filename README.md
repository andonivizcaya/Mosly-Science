# Mostly-Science
I'll try to upload my science (in most cases Physics/Math) related codes here. You can help, suggest and give me new ideas.

### Prerequisites

Liking science, having some coding knowledge and crazy ideas.

```
For example, trying to give a way to visualize the generalized functional derivative.
Maybe something less abstract, or maybe completely out of this world.
```

### Installing

If the program is in python, you'll need to have installed at least numpy, matplotlib, scipy. If the program is Matlab and you prefer to use Octave,
I will put some comments with the list of packages you need to install.

If the program requires something else, it will have some comments too. For example:

```
Octave: go to https://octave.sourceforge.io/packages.php and download the 'Symbolic Package'.
        Follow the instructions to install.
        I you have problems to install it google your error or ask me.
```

```
Python: use the command pip install 'your package' or if you have Anaconda installed, 
        conda install 'your package'. You can visit 
        https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/ if you want to know more.
```

```
C/C++: Maybe I'll be using these languages too. So be prepared.
```
Finally, if you want to run your oun version, you're free to do that and give your feedback.
